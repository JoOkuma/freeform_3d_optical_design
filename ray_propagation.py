v0.0.2

Techniques for fabricating freeform 3D refractive optics are rapidly
maturing. By 'freeform', I don't just mean the shape - I mean optics
where at each voxel, we can specify the refractive index of the
material. This unlocks crazy new possibilities for optical design - but
how shall we design these optics?

Using gradient search, just like training a neural network!

This module defines a `Refractive3dOptic` class for designing freeform
3D refractive optics, and includes some example code for how to use this
class in the `example_of_usage` string below.

        We store our refractive object on a 3D grid, and use
        interpolation to define the index of refraction between grid
        points. How shall we simulate ray propagation through this
        object? We'd like an accurate method, but every voxel of the
        object that we "touch" during each step of forward propagation
        adds to the computational graph.

        The Runge-Kutta method from Sharma (1982):
        doi.org/10.1364/AO.21.000984
        ...with trilinear interpolation and constant time step `dt`,
        gives fast, accurate, simple ray tracing in gradient-index
        refractive objects.
        
        Unfortunately, this doesn't combine well with the pytorch memory
        model. The constant time step means bundles of rays spread out
        in z, and we end up adding a large 3D chunk of the object to the
        computational graph for every time step. We also use many small
        time steps for high accuracy, so backpropagation is VERY
        expensive.

        Euler's method:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method
        ...with nearest-neighbor interpolation and constant z-step size,
        gives lower accuracy, and the resulting error builds to
        intolerable levesl over many steps.

        However, this combines extremely well with the pytorch memory
        model. The constant z-step means bundles of rays stay in the
        same z-plane, so we add one 2D slice of the object to the
        computational graph for every z-step. We use also use large
        z-steps (equal to the z-spacing of our object's 3D grid), so
        backpropagation is VERY cheap.

        Here, we get the best of both worlds: the accuracy of RK, and
        the efficient backprop of Euler:
         * Turn off autograd and compute accurate ray paths with RK.
         * Turn on autograd and compute differentiable ray paths with Euler.
         * After each Euler z-step, we add a small non-differentiable
           correction based on the RK result. The resulting ray path is
           given by RK, but the differentiability is given by Euler.
         * Since our ray paths are accurate, the resulting gradients are
           nearly identical to the gradients given by backprop through
           RK, but MUCH cheaper to compute.

        I'm pretty happy with this algorithm. I think it's awesome.
